# Scenario_A

Hey there,

Our records indicate you were marked as absent in the most recent session. We've reviewed your attendance and it shows that you were only present for 10 minutes for the 1-hour class. To avoid this next time, please keep in mind to be present for at least half of the duration of the class.

There are also **excused absences**, which must be requested in advance through the CodePath [Course Portal](https://courses.codepath.com/), click the **Quick Actions** drop down and select **Request Excused Absence**

As you know, attendance is core to our educational model! We only allow 3 absences with prior notice and unexcused absences (No Call, No Show) are not permitted, even one unexcused absence may result in removal from the course as outlined in our [course policies](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19).


All the best,
CodePath.org Team
