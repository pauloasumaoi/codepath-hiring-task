# Scenario_D

Hey there,

Congratulations on your internship!

We've now moved you as an 'observer' to the course. This means:

1. You will have lifetime access to the course material and can study it at their own pace.
2. No due dates or any expectations of observers imposed by us.
3. You will be invited to join our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) to receive updates on upcoming courses and events.

If you have other concerns, please let us know.


All the best,
CodePath.org Team
