# Scenario_B

Hi Pia,

We can only give second chances for students with extenuating circumstances (ex. Death in the Family, Accident).

Unfortunately, because of your full schedule due to work and 4 consecutive absences, we are unable to reconsider your withdrawal from the course.

You can still take the course again next semester when you have less load and better availability. We're sorry for this, and we understand your eagerness to learn but we don't want you to be overworked.

We look forward to seeing you next semester.


All the best,
CodePath.org Team
